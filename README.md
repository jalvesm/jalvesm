<b>ðŸŒ± Hey there!</b>
<p align="justify">
I'm currently a second-year software engineering student at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais. Throughout my academic journey, I've discovered my interest in the intersection of mathematics and technology, particularly in statistical operations and data-related topics. I have been learning programming languages such as C, Java, and Python. Recently, data modelling, managing, and manipulating relational databases have played a significant role in my interest related to the world of data! 

<p align="justify">
 I'm also in my first-year internship, and this hands-on opportunity has been guiding me to understand a bit about the universe of backend technologies and modern software development practices. I'm currently learning how to create and implement APIs alongside cloud computing tools. It has been a pleasant journey so far, full of getting to know and learning from people with different backgrounds and interests!
