<br><b>üå± Hey there!</b>
<p align="justify">
Nice to have you here! I am a student @ Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, currently in the 2nd year (4th semester) of software engineering. So far, my interests in this field have been centred on mathematics, and due to this, statistical operations with data-related problems have really captured my attention! I have been afforded with the opportunity to develop applications in C, Java, and Python. I'm also experiencing my first year of internship along with the university, where I deal not only with back-end technologies such as APIs written in NodeJs, but also tools in cloud computing provided by AWS.</p>
