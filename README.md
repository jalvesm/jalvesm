<b>ðŸŒ± Hey there!</b>
<p align="justify">
I'm currently a second-year software engineering student at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais. Throughout my academic journey, I have been learning programming languages such as Java, C and Python. I found my interest in the intersection of mathematics and programming, particularly in statistical methods and data-related topics. Recently, data modelling, managing, and manipulating relational databases have played a significant role in my interest related to the world of data! I'm also in my first-year internship, and this hands-on opportunity has been guiding me to understand a bit about the universe of backend technologies and modern software development practices.
